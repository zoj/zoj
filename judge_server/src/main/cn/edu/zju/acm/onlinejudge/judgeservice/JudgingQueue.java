/**
 * This class is a queue of all submissions being judged.
 * 
 * All submissions are put in a single linked list. Removal operations only move the head reference forward without
 * changing the internal linked list structure. Once a JudgingQueueIterator instance is created, it copies the current
 * head reference. In this way, a JudgingQueueIterator instance can always traverse all nodes created subsequent to its
 * construction.
 * 
 * We expect this queue to be short. A submission is pushed into this queue when its judge starts and removed when judge
 * ends. This is usually less than 1 minute. And we do not expect many judge threads using this queue.
 * 
 * Nodes can be garbage collected when it is not reachable from the head and by any JudgingQueueIterator. So as long as
 * we expect that the life of a JudgingQueueIterator stays short, like in seconds, this queue does not cost too much
 * memory.
 * 
 * This implementation is thread safe and lock-free just like ConcurrentLinkedQueue.
 * 
 * The same submission may be push into this queue multiple times. When this happens, the linked list will contains
 * multiple nodes with the same submission reference. It is safe excepting using a bit more memory. Usually this is not
 * a problem.
